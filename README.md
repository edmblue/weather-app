### ðŸ“‘ End note 

I had already used this API but I wanted to give it a little more professional touch, or better design, I got the inspiration on the internet, it was a lot of fun to do and I became more agile with TailwindCSS

<sub>**Additional**: It's funny how it shows that the app is mostly done witn CSS! I think it's because I had to import al the CSS files in order to use the Weather Icons. No regrets!</sub>
